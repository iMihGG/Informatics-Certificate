Informatics certficate
Time for implementation - 6 hours
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This application was made in order to obtain my certificate in Informatics
and contains a landscape drawing, a car race and a snake game, most of them
implemented using graphic libraries from C++.
    The programme runs as an interactive application, with user input, using
both the graphic windowd and the command line in order to let the user input
the desired instructions. The application starts with a drawing of a landscape
if the user wishes so, then he has to make a decision: either he plays Snake
or watches a car race.
    Both the lanscape and the car race are implemented using elementary graphic
mode functions and the Snake game was done with the standard librabry of C++.
The Snake game has 4 functions which determine the logic of the game, as well
as the drawing required in order for the user to visualize the moving snake.
